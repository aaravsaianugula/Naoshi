# Naoshi - Precision STL Repair Studio

![Naoshi Banner](web/logo.png)

**Naoshi** (直し - Japanese for "repair/fix") is a powerful, local-first 3D mesh repair and editing studio designed for makers and 3D printing enthusiasts. It specializes in fixing broken STL/OBJ files—especially those generated by AI tools like Rodin or Meshy—making them watertight and 3D printable.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Deep Mesh Repair**: Automatically fixes non-manifold geometry, holes, and flipped normals using advanced algorithms (Alpha Wrap, Poisson Reconstruction).
- **Anime-Style Repair Visualization**: Watch your model transform with beautiful "Spirit Restoration" effects during repair.
- **CAD-Style Editing**: Move, rotate, and scale models with a familiar Gizmo.
- **Sketch & Extrude**: Draw 2D shapes on a plane and extrude them into solid 3D volumes (perfect for creating bases or stands).
- **Smart Validation**: Instantly checks if your model is "Watertight" and print-ready upon loading.
- **100% Local**: All processing happens securely on your machine. No cloud uploads needed.

3. Watch the progress with the anime-style "Spirit Restoration" effect:
   - The model transforms from sketch to fully rendered as it repairs
   - Camera slowly orbits for a cinematic view
   - Progress sweeps from bottom to top
4. When complete, click **Download Fixed** to save your repaired model.

### 2. Editing & Extrusion
